Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan WJ. A learner, developer, a Problem Solver Above All. 
He/Him, GMT +8. Proficient in Python, Javascript, C++, SQL, and Cypher Query Language. 

Projects: 
Deep Learning: -	Led team to 1st place in Brainhack Today I Learnt - AI (Novice Category) organised by Defence Science and Technology Agency, Singapore. Designed and fine-tuned deep learning models for Automatic Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing and Vision Language Modelling, within the context of programming an automatic air defence turret. 
Data Visualisation: Utilised Neo4j/Cypher framework to create a graph database from anonymised patient data under mentorship of A*STAR Machine Intellection Scientist. Applied graph data analysis algorithms to investigate correlations between different diabetes complications to optimise hospital resource allocation. Published academic report with LaTeX.  
Web-based Simulation: Developed a JavaScript agent-based computer simulation of dynamic personnel movements in order to model dangerous outcomes in evacuation scenarios.


Looking forward to collaborate and contribute to projects. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence, and especially how it will augment humanity's capabilities.
Currently applying to university to deepen my knowledge and contribute to technological solutions.
